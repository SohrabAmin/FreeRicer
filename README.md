### Motivation
Despite the consensus that [Free Rice](https://freerice.com) uses ad revenue to donate rice, the concept of creating a program to answer questions automatically, that in return assist a worthy cause deemed compelling enough. Honestly, I wanted to attempt using version control with someone other than myself and sharpen my `selenium` skills.
